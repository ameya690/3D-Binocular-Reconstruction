# 3D Scene Unnderstanding Using Binocular Images

This is part of my 7th semester major project with Prof Jyoti Madake. The project explores reconstructing a 3D depth image from two 2D with known caliberations. 
For better understanding, kindly refer the paper written for the same: '3D Scene Understanding using Binocular Images.pdf'

We worked on the Middlebury Stereo dataset for the 2D images, and used the Cloud Compare open source software for reconstructing the point cloud, 'point_cloud.txt.
